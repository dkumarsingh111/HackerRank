Important Instructions about Programming Assignments: 

1. Programming assignments will be evaluated automatically. Do not change the skeleton code provided to you. 2. Write your code only in the designated places in the skeleton code and process the input data provided to you in the designated variables. Do not alter the input-output structure in the skeleton code. 3. Do not import any additional libraries. Do not use any additional files for the processing (other than those mentioned in the skeleton code). 4. Failure to comply with these instructions may lead to you getting zero marks for the assignment, even if the solution is largely correct. 5. The evaluation is binary, i.e., either you get full marks if your output exactly matches the evaluation test cases (different from Sample Test Cases provided in the question) otherwise you get a zero. There is no provision for step marking.

Objective: This assignment has two objectives: 1. Understanding how to implement Image Classification model using PyTorch. 2. Develop a pipeline to solve the MNIST classification problem and output model accuracy.

Instructions: Download the dataset along with template program and write your code in the designated location mentioned in the comments only. You are required only to write the sequential model for feature extractor, classifier and forward (feature extractor THEN classifier). The dataset must be in the current working directory with the structure data/MNIST/raw/*. You should read the skeleton code to understand the exact mechanism of input from the command line and provide the required output. To train and test modified AlexNet with 1 and 2 MNIST classes with 4 training epochs, the command line input should be: python template.py 1 2 4
