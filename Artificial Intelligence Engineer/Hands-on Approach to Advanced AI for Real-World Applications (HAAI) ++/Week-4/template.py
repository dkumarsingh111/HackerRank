"""
This program is build with Flan-T5-XL LLM to be able to answer the final question using the output from the previous questions as in-context learning/few-shot learning. 

Consider three related questions from a search session: Question 1, Question 2, Question 3
1. Answer to Question 1 needs to be generated. 
2. Answer to Question 2 needs to be generated with the answer to Question 1 as one-shot example / context. 
3. Answer to Question 3 needs to be generated with the answer to Question 2 as one-shot example / context.
4. Answer to Question 3 will be either YES or NO and nothing else.


> The program accepts three parameters provided as a command line input. 
> The three inputs represent the questions.
> The output of the first two question is Generation based whereas the last question output is deterministic i.e. its either YES or NO.
> Output should be in upper-case: YES or NO
> There should be no additional output including any warning messages in the terminal.
> Remember that your output will be tested against test cases, therefore any deviation from the test cases will be considered incorrect during evaluation.


Syntax: python template.py <string> <string> <string> 

The following example is given for your reference:

 Terminal Input: python template.py "Who is Rabindranath Tagore?" "Where was he born?" "Is it in America?"
Terminal Output: NO

 Terminal Input: python template.py "Who is Rabindranath Tagore?" "Where was he born?" "Is it in India?"
Terminal Output: YES

You are expected to create some examples of your own to test the correctness of your approach.

ALL THE BEST!!
